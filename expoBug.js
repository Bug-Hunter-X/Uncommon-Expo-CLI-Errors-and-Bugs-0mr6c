This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage a React Native project and can manifest in various ways, such as build failures, unexpected behavior during development, or runtime crashes.  One root cause is often inconsistencies or conflicts within the project's configuration files (e.g., `app.json`, `package.json`, `babel.config.js`, etc.).  Another common cause is outdated or incompatible dependencies. This can be further compounded by issues related to the Expo Go app, local environment settings, or even interactions with other installed software.
