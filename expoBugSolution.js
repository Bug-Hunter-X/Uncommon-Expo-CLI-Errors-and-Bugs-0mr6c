The solution depends on the specific error.  For configuration issues, carefully review `app.json`, `package.json`, and related config files, ensuring consistency between them.  Outdated or conflicting dependencies can be addressed by updating packages using `expo upgrade` and resolving conflicting versions in `package.json`.  Cleaning the cache (`expo prebuild --clean`) and restarting the development server can sometimes alleviate transient issues. If problems persist, examine Expo Go logs for additional clues. Environment variable conflicts, including paths or other settings, might also need investigation.  Providing detailed error messages from the Expo CLI is essential for accurate troubleshooting.
